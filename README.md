# Rangsk's Variant Sudoku Solver - JavaScript Web Worker

This is an implementation of my Variant Sudoku Solver in JavaScript intended to be used as a Web Worker.

More details coming soon.

# License

The LGPL license is intended to signify that any changes or improvements you make the the solver itself should be open sourced, but I don't care if the host application that uses the solver is itself open source. Either way, I'd like some form credit if my solver is used in your application.

I am open to any contributions via PR.
